# React Add-Ons Change Log

As of React v15.5.0 we discontinued active maintenance of the React Addons
packages. In previous versions of React we kept the version numbers of
these packages in sync with the React version, and included updates to
them in the main React `CHANGELOG.md`.

Since the release versions of these packages are now out of sync with React,
and we are no longer including them as a supported part of React, we have split
out the latest changes into this separate change log.

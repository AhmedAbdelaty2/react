# react-addons-css-transition-group

This package is deprecated and will no longer work with React 16+. We recommend you use `CSSTransitionGroup` from [`react-transition-group`](https://github.com/reactjs/react-transition-group) instead.

In particular, its version `1.1.1` is a drop-in replacement for the last released version of `react-addons-css-transition-group`. You can install `react-transition-group@1.1.1` on npm, and replace its imports with `react-transition-group/CSSTransitionGroup` to migrate. The documentation branch for that version [can be found here](https://github.com/reactjs/react-transition-group/tree/v1.1.1#high-level-api-csstransitiongroup).

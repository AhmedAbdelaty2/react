# `react-events`

*This package is experimental. It is intended for use with the experimental React
events API that is not available in open source builds.*

The core API is documented below. Documentation for individual Event Components
can be found [here](./docs).

## Event Responder

An Event Responder is used with the hook `React.unstable_useResponder`:

The hook is called with a `responder`, `ref` and a `props` object. After mount, the
`responder` and `ref` passed to the same hook will not update the responders internals â€“ only passing new `props` will.

Each responder can define DOM events to listen to, handle the synthetic responder events, dispatch custom
events, and implement a state machine.

```js
// types
type ResponderEventType =
  | string
  | {name: string, passive?: boolean};

type ResponderEvent = {|
  nativeEvent: any,
  target: Element | Document,
  type: string,
  passive: boolean,
  passiveSupported: boolean,
|};

type CustomEvent = {
  type: string,
  target: Element,
  ...
}
```

### getInitialState?: (props: null | Object) => Object

The initial state of that the Event Responder instance is created with.

### onEvent?: (event: ResponderEvent, context: ResponderContext, props, state)

Called during the bubble phase of the `targetEventTypes` dispatched on DOM
elements within the Event Responder.

### onMount?: (context: ResponderContext, props, state)

Called after an Event Responder instance in mounted.

### onOwnershipChange?: (context: ResponderContext, props, state)

Called when ownership is granted or terminated (either globally or for the responder) for an Event Responder instance.

### onRootEvent?: (event: ResponderEvent, context: ResponderContext, props, state)

Called when any of the `rootEventTypes` are dispatched on the root of the app.

### onUnmount?: (context: ResponderContext, props, state)

Called before an Event Responder instance is unmounted.

### rootEventTypes?: Array<ResponderEventType>

Defines the DOM events to listen to on the root of the app.

### targetEventTypes?: Array<ResponderEventType>

Defines the DOM events to listen to within the Event Responder subtree.


## ResponderContext

The Event Responder Context is exposed via the `context` argument for certain methods
on the `EventResponder` object.

### addRootEventTypes(eventTypes: Array<ResponderEventType>)

This can be used to dynamically listen to events on the root of the app only
when it is necessary to do so.

### clearTimeout(id: Symbol): void

Clear a timeout defined using `context.setTimeout`.

### dispatchEvent(event: CustomEvent, listener, { discrete: boolean })

Dispatches a custom synthetic event. The `type` and `target` are required
fields, but any other fields can be defined on the `event` that will be passed
to the `listener`. For example:

```js
const event = { type: 'press', target, pointerType, x, y };
context.dispatchEvent(event, props.onPress, { discrete: true });
```

### getFocusableElementsInScope(deep: boolean): Array<Element>

Returns every DOM element that can be focused within the scope of the Event
Component instance.

### hasOwnership(): boolean

Returns `true` if the instance has taken ownership of the responder.

### isTargetWithinNode(target: Element, element: Element): boolean

Returns `true` if `target` is a child of `element`.

### isTargetWithinResponder(target: Element): boolean

Returns `true` is the target element is within the subtree of the Event Responder instance.

### isTargetWithinResponderScope(target: Element): boolean

Returns `true` is the target element is within the current Event Responder's scope. If the target element
is within the scope of the same responder, but owned by another Event Responder, this will return `false`.

### releaseOwnership(): boolean

Returns `true` if the instance released ownership of the Event Responder instance.

### removeRootEventTypes(eventTypes: Array<ResponderEventType>)

Remove the root event types added with `addRootEventTypes`.

### requestGlobalOwnership(): boolean

The current Event Responder instance can request global ownership of the event system. When an Event Responder instance
has global ownership, only that instance and its responder are active. To release ownership to other event responders,
either `releaseOwnership()` must be called or the Event Responder instance that had global ownership must be
unmounted. Calling `requestGlobalOwnership` also returns `true`/`false` if the request was successful.

### setTimeout(func: () => void, delay: number): Symbol

This can be used to dispatch async events, e.g., those that fire after a delay.

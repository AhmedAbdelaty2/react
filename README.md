React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

* **Declarative:** React makes it painless to create interactive UIs. Design simple views for each state in your application, and React will efficiently update and render just the right components when your data changes. Declarative views make your code more predictable, simpler to understand, and easier to debug.
* **Component-Based:** Build encapsulated components that manage their own state, then compose them to make complex UIs. Since component logic is written in JavaScript instead of templates, you can easily pass rich data through your app and keep the state out of the DOM.
* **Learn Once, Write Anywhere:** We don't make assumptions about the rest of your technology stack, so you can develop new features in React without rewriting existing code. React can also render on the server using Node and power mobile apps using [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/).

[Learn how to use React in your project](https://react.dev/learn/installation).

## Installation

React has been designed for gradual adoption from the start, and **you can use as little or as much React as you need**:

* [Try React](https://react.dev/learn/installation#try-react) using online sandboxes. You donâ€™t need to install anything.
* [Start a New React Project](https://react.dev/learn/start-a-new-react-project) if you want to build a new app or a new website fully with React.
* [Add React to an Existing Project](https://react.dev/learn/add-react-to-an-existing-project) if you want to add some interactivity to your existing project.

## Documentation

You can find the React documentation [on the website](https://react.dev/).  

Check out the [Quick Start](https://react.dev/learn) page for an introduction to the 80% of React concepts that you will use on a daily basis.

The documentation is divided into several sections:

**Get Started**
* [Quick Start](https://react.dev/learn)
* [Installation](https://react.dev/learn/installation)

**Learn React**
* [Describing the UI](https://react.dev/learn/describing-the-ui)
* [Adding Interactivity](https://react.dev/learn/adding-interactivity)
* [Managing State](https://react.dev/learn/managing-state)
* [Escape Hatches](https://react.dev/learn/escape-hatches)

**Reference**
* [react](https://react.dev/reference/react)
* [react-dom](https://react.dev/reference/react-dom)
* [Legacy React APIs](https://react.dev/reference/react/legacy)

You can improve it by sending pull requests to [this repository](https://github.com/reactjs/react.dev).

## Examples

We have several examples [on the website](https://react.dev/). Here is one to get you started:

```jsx
import { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client';

function HelloMessage({ name }) {
  return <div>Hello {name}</div>;
}

const root = createRoot(document.getElementById('container'));
root.render(<HelloMessage name="Taylor" />);
```

This example will render "Hello Taylor" into a container on the page.

We are [Writing Markup with JSX](https://react.dev/learn/writing-markup-with-jsx), a syntax extension for JavaScript that lets you write HTML-like markup inside a JavaScript file. Although there are other ways to write components, most React developers prefer the conciseness of JSX, and most codebases use it.

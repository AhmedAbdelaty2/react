React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

* **Declarative:** React makes it painless to create interactive UIs. Design simple views for each state in your application, and React will efficiently update and render just the right components when your data changes. Declarative views make your code more predictable, simpler to understand, and easier to debug.
* **Component-Based:** Build encapsulated components that manage their own state, then compose them to make complex UIs. Since component logic is written in JavaScript instead of templates, you can easily pass rich data through your app and keep the state out of the DOM.
* **Learn Once, Write Anywhere:** We don't make assumptions about the rest of your technology stack, so you can develop new features in React without rewriting existing code. React can also render on the server using [Node](https://nodejs.org/en) and power mobile apps using [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/).

## Why use React? 
Integrating React.js in a front-end project is crucial in cases where you want a dynamic and responsive
interface for user experience purposes. React allows developers to build encapsulated components that
make it easy to develop, test, and maintain the state of the application. React also updates the Document
Object Model (DOM) to optimize rendering of components on the user interface. 
Additionally, React has a large base of tools, extensions, and libraries, making it easier to customize applications towards user needs. 
This allows for greater efficiency of user interfaces in serving the goals of the application at large. 

## Key Features of React 
Below are common key features of React.js that make it effective in full stack applications: 
 1. JSX (JavaScript XML) - JSX allows you to create React componens in a simplified manner as opposed 
 to creating multiple redundant functions within a JavaScript code file. 
 2. React Router - React Router allows you to navigate betweeen different pages of the User Interface (UI) without redundant functions in the code file for each page. This makes your application faster. 
 3. Virtual DOM - React.js creates a virtual representation of the DOM in memory, specifically updating the parts of the DOM that are relevant to the project. 
 More information about the implementation and uses of these features can be found on the React documentation: (https://react.dev/learn). 

## Installation

React has been designed for gradual adoption from the start, and **you can use as little or as much React as you need**:

* Use [Quick Start](https://react.dev/learn) to get a taste of React.
* [Add React to an Existing Project](https://react.dev/learn/add-react-to-an-existing-project) to use as little or as much React as you need.
* [Create a New React App](https://react.dev/learn/start-a-new-react-project) if you're looking for a powerful JavaScript toolchain.

## Documentation

You can find the React documentation [on the website](https://react.dev/).

Check out the [Getting Started](https://react.dev/learn) page for a quick overview.

The documentation is divided into several sections:

* [Quick Start](https://react.dev/learn)
* [Tutorial](https://react.dev/learn/tutorial-tic-tac-toe)
* [Thinking in React](https://react.dev/learn/thinking-in-react)
* [Installation](https://react.dev/learn/installation)
* [Describing the UI](https://react.dev/learn/describing-the-ui)
* [Adding Interactivity](https://react.dev/learn/adding-interactivity)
* [Managing State](https://react.dev/learn/managing-state)
* [Advanced Guides](https://react.dev/learn/escape-hatches)
* [API Reference](https://react.dev/reference/react)
* [Where to Get Support](https://react.dev/community)
* [Contributing Guide](https://legacy.reactjs.org/docs/how-to-contribute.html)

You can improve it by sending pull requests to [this repository](https://github.com/reactjs/react.dev).

## Examples

We have several examples [on the website](https://react.dev/). Here is the first one to get you started:

```jsx
import { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client';

function HelloMessage({ name }) {
  return <div>Hello {name}</div>;
}

const root = createRoot(document.getElementById('container'));
root.render(<HelloMessage name="Taylor" />);
```

This example will render "Hello Taylor" into a container on the page.

You'll notice that we used an HTML-like syntax; [we call it JSX](https://react.dev/learn#writing-markup-with-jsx). JSX is not required to use React, but it makes code more readable, and writing it feels like writing HTML.

## Steps to Clone and Interact with this Repository 
If you are a beginner to Github and Git, or just open source projects in general, follow these steps to clone and interact with the repository. 
 1. Fork the repository on Github using the 'Fork' button
 2. On your forked repository, click on the Green 'Code' button, copy the link, and type 'git clone [link here]' in your VSCode terminal. 
 3. Navigate to the 'react' directory by using the 'cd' command. 
 4. You can then open the specific code files, or the ReadME.md file, that you are interested in modifying or learning about. 
 5. If you want to see the output of the codebase, or test modifications, type 'npm run' in the VSCode terminal. 
NOTE: If you do not have React installed, type 'npm install' in the VSCode terminal, and follow instructions in the React documentation.

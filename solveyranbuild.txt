Without your package.json it's hard to tell where exactly the problem is.

If your version for your package (or any of the dependencies) isn't using a semantic versioning (for example 6.10.0 instead of just 6.10 which might get trimmed to 6.1) then that is what is causing the problem.

When the error mentions minor/patch it is referring to the numbers separated by dots/periods

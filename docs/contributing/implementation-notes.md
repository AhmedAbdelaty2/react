This section is a collection of implementation notes for the [stack reconciler](/react/contributing/codebase-overview.html#stack-reconciler). It is very technical and assumes a strong understanding of React public API as well as how it's divided into core, renderers, and the reconciler. If you're not very familiar with the React codebase, read [the codebase overview](/react/contributing/codebase-overview.html) first.

### WIP

TODO

### Next Steps

Read the [next section](/react/contributing/design-principles.html) to learn about the guiding principles we use for React development.

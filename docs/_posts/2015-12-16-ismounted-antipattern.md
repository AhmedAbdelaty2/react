title: "isMounted is an Antipattern"

As we move closer to officially deprecating isMounted, it's worth understanding why the function is an antipattern, and how to write code without the isMounted function.

The primary use case for `isMounted()` is to avoid calling `setState()` after a component has unmounted, because calling `setState()` after a component has unmounted will emit a warning. The “setState warning” exists to help you catch bugs, because calling `setState()` on an unmounted component is an indication that your app/component has somehow failed to clean up properly. Specifically, calling `setState()` in an unmounted component means that your app is still holding a reference to the component after the component has been unmounted - which often indicates a memory leak!

To avoid the error message, people often add lines like this:

```js
if(this.isMounted()) { // This is bad.
  this.setState({...});
}
```

Checking `isMounted` before calling `setState()` does eliminate the warning, but it also defeats the purpose of the warning, since now you will never get the warning (even when you should!)

Other uses of `isMounted()` are similarly erroneous; using `isMounted()` is a code smell because the only reason you would check is because you think you might be holding a reference after the component has unmounted.

An easy migration strategy for anyone upgrading their code to avoid `isMounted()` is to track the mounted status yourself.  Just set a `_isMounted` property to true in `componentDidMount` and set it to false in `componentWillUnmount`, and use this variable to check your component's status.

An optimal solution would be to find places where `setState()` might be called after a component has unmounted, and fix them. Such situations most commonly occur due to callbacks, when a component is waiting for some data and gets unmounted before the data arrives. Ideally, any callbacks should be canceled in `componentWillUnmount`, prior to unmounting.

For instance, if you are using a Flux store in your component, you must unsubscribe in `componentWillUnmount`:

```javascript{9}
class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  componentDidMount() {
    mydatastore.subscribe(this);
  }
  render() {
    ...
  }
  componentWillUnmount() {
    mydatastore.unsubscribe(this);
  }
}
```

If you use ES6 promises, you will need to manage your promise in order to prevent the `then` stage of the Promise chain from executing. 

```js
const managedPromise = managePromise(
  /* In actual practice, this is where we would pass our Promise-returning async call: 
     The code below simply simulates such call */
  new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    // callback invoked upon success of some async call
    const successCallback = (val) => {
      console.log('async call was successful')
      resolve(val)
    }
    // simulating async call
    setTimeout(successCallback, 1000, 'success')

    // In actual practice, we'd also have a failureCallback that reject()'s the promise with
    // some error value
  })
);

managedPromise
  .promise
  .then((val) => {
    // call to component.setState goes here, so it can be prevented by 
    console.log('resolved with', val)
  })
  .catch((reason) => console.log('cancelThen', reason.cancelThen));

managedPromise.cancelThen(); // Cancel the 'then' on managed promise
```

Where `managePromise` was originally [defined by @istarkov](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/5465#issuecomment-157888325) and [modified by @idibidiart](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/9801) as:

```js
const managePromise = (originalPromise) => {
  let cancelThen = false;

  const wrappedPromise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    originalPromise.then(
      val => cancelThen ? reject({cancelThen: true}) : resolve(val),
      error => cancelThen ? reject({cancelThen: true}) : reject(error)
    );
  });

  return {
    promise: wrappedPromise,
    cancelThen() {
      cancelThen = true;
    },
  };
};
```
As an added bonus for getting your code cleaned up early, getting rid of `isMounted()` makes it one step easier for you to upgrade to ES6 classes, where using `isMounted()` is not supported.  Happy coding!

* _Update 2017-05-12: altered `#makeCancelable` implementation so rejected promises won't go uncaught._
* _Update 2017-05-30: eliminated confusion with respect to ES Promise spec by changing `#makeCancelable` to `#managePromise` since 'Cancellable' means something else in ES spec Promise discussions. Also, changed `#cancel()` to `#cancelThen()` and moved `component.setState` to the `then` stage so that it can be prevented from being invoked after component has been unmounted.

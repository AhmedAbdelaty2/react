Every couple of weeks someone asks us when are we going to organize a conference for React. This time has finally come! It's going to be [January 28 & 29 on Facebook Campus in California](http://conf.reactjs.com/).

Before we open registration, [we're looking for great talks](http://conf.reactjs.com/call-for-presenters.html). We want to see how you pushed application development forward! If you ever talked to a meet-up, pitched React to your co-workers or done something awesome and want to talk about it, let us know!

Here are some areas of research we want to explore during the conference if you need some inspiration: server-side rendering, data fetching, language features (eg es6, clojure), immutability, rendering targets (eg svg, canvas), real-time updates...

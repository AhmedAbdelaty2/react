React has a few built-in event plugins to make your life easier.

  * `TapEventPlugin` provides an `onTouchTap` event which is similar to the so-called **fast click** event. This looks at raw touch events (`touchstart` `touchmove` and `touchend`) and interprets if the user intended to do a simple tap.
  * `ResponderEventPlugin` implements a responder model to negotiate events between multiple components. See [the source code](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/master/src/eventPlugins/ResponderEventPlugin.js) for more information.

To install these plugins, you need to call `React.addons.injectEventPluginsByName()` like this:

```javascript
React.addons.injectEventPluginsByName({
  TapEventPlugin: React.addons.TapEventPlugin,
  ResponderEventPlugin: React.addons.ResponderEventPlugin
});
```

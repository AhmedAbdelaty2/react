## Basic Principles

React provides a `ClassNameGenerator` addon component as an API for creating classNames based on configuration object you pass

## High-level API:
`ClassNameGenerator` is using some key concepts and names from BEM methodology. By default BEM naming is disabled but can be enabled via configuration

### Key concepts
Before describing `ClassNameGenerator` it's important to understand some key concepts of classNames naming convention. There are three main entities that should be explained:

##### Block
A logically and functionally independent page component that can be reused.

##### Element
A constituent part of a block that can't be used outside of it.

##### Modifier
className that defines appearance or behavior of an element/block. For example 'active' class on active menu element or 'hidden' class on hidden element are modifiers.


### Getting Started

'ClassNameGenerator' is an instance of `ReactClassNameGenerator` class which is created by passing configuration object with desired block and element names.
`ClassNameGenerator.config` is ReactClassNameGenerator Class and can be used to change ReactClassNameGenerator default configuration.
